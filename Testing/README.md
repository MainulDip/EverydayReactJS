### Unit Testing:
Testing a very small part of the application. Thus "unit" naming.


### Integration Testing
Testing Multiple units of the application if those are working correctly together. Combine multiple unit test into one large test

### End-to-End Testing:
Front to Back testing. Mimicking an actual user using the application on the browser.
